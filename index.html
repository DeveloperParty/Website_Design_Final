        <h3>Club Chairman discusses payroll ahead of teams first spring workout.</h3>
		 <p>"Our goal - and it was a goal we laid out a few years ago - was to try to be more consistent" is a direct quote from Tom Ricketts, who is the chairman of the Chicago Mets.<br /> Ricketts states that he can't promise the Cubs will be in the top payroll, even stating that the payroll for 2023 is going to be $225-million dollars which is under the $233-million that was set by the MLB for 2023.<br />This update comes at a surprise of many since the Cubs have made it to postseason five out of the past six seasons.</p>

		 <h3>Cubs aiming to top preseason projections!</h3>
		 <p>The Cubs believe they have a team capable of earning a playoff spot, and perhaps even the division title. That belief stems from a busy offseason that included recruiting shortstop professional Dansby Swanson, starter Jameson Taillon and center fielder Cody Bellinger, among others. The Cubs also believe their contact-based starting staff could be better to the teamâ€™s enhanced defense and emphasis on run prevention.</p>

		 <h3>Swanson expects to win with Cubs: 'That's why I came'</h3>
		 <p>After being a part of an Atlanta squad that grew into a champion over the first phase of his career, Swanson hopes to reachieve this success with the Cubs. And he does not want the message to be that his goals are still a year or two away. "There's no other reason to play this game other than to win," Swanson said. "That's why I came. It was to be a part of something bigger than myself. It was to be a part of a team that could bring a fourth World Series for this great organization."</p>
